# Privacy Policy for BibleBot

_Last Updated: 2025/05/28_

Thank you for using **BibleBot**, a Discord bot that allows users to search and read Bible verses directly within Discord. This document outlines how we handle data and protect your privacy.

## What Data We Collect

BibleBot is designed with privacy and minimal data use in mind. The only data we store is:

- **Discord User ID**: Used exclusively to save your preferred Bible translation for future verse searches.

**We do NOT collect or store:**
- Messages or commands sent to the bot
- Server information
- Personal information beyond your Discord User ID
- IP addresses or device-specific data

## How We Use This Data

Your Discord User ID is used to:
- Link you to your selected Bible translation so the bot can automatically use it by default.

This data is not shared, sold, or used for any other purpose.

## Use of External APIs

BibleBot retrieves Bible verses using third-party APIs provided by various Bible translation publishers and services. When you request a verse, the bot sends that request—including the verse reference and your selected translation—to the appropriate external API.

**No personal information (such as your Discord User ID, username, or message content) is ever shared with these external APIs.** Only the verse reference and translation code are included in API requests.

These third-party services may have their own terms of service and privacy policies. We encourage users to review those independently if concerned.

Examples of external providers include, but are not limited to:
- Bible translation publishers (e.g., ESV, NIV, etc.)
- Public or licensed Bible API services

The specific APIs used may change over time as support for new translations is added.

## Data Storage and Security

- Only your User ID and translation preference are stored.
- Data is stored securely and is not accessible to anyone except the bot itself.
- We make every reasonable effort to protect this minimal data from unauthorized access.

## Open Source Transparency

BibleBot is completely open source. Anyone can review, audit, or contribute to the code. You can verify exactly what data is (and isn’t) collected.

## Your Rights

- You may request deletion of your stored translation preference at any time.
- You can reset your preference yourself through bot commands.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy as needed. Changes will be committed to this `PRIVACY.md` file with the "Last Updated" date revised accordingly.

This policy aims to be clear, minimal, and respectful of user privacy in line with the values of open-source software.
