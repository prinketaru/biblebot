# Privacy Policy for BibleBot

_Last Updated: 2025/05/28_

Thank you for using **BibleBot**, a Discord bot that allows users to search and read Bible verses directly within Discord. This document outlines how we handle data and protect your privacy.

## What Data We Collect

BibleBot is designed with privacy and minimal data use in mind. The only data we store is:

- **Discord User ID**: Used exclusively to save your preferred Bible translation for future verse searches.

**We do NOT collect or store:**
- Messages or commands sent to the bot
- Server information
- Personal information beyond your Discord User ID
- IP addresses or device-specific data

## How We Use This Data

Your Discord User ID is used to:
- Link you to your selected Bible translation so the bot can automatically use it by default.

This data is not shared, sold, or used for any other purpose.

## Data Storage and Security

- Only your User ID and translation preference are stored.
- Data is stored securely and is not accessible to anyone except the bot itself.
- We make every reasonable effort to protect this minimal data from unauthorized access.

## Open Source Transparency

BibleBot is completely open source. Anyone can review, audit, or contribute to the code. You can verify exactly what data is (and isnâ€™t) collected.

## Your Rights

- You may request deletion of your stored translation preference at any time.
- You can reset your preference yourself through bot commands.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy as needed. Changes will be committed to this `PRIVACY.md` file with the "Last Updated" date revised accordingly.
