## 3. Data and Privacy

BibleBot collects and stores only minimal user data as outlined in the [`PRIVACY.md`](./PRIVACY.md) file:

- Only your **Discord User ID** is stored, and only to remember your preferred Bible translation.
- No messages, server data, or other personal data is collected or stored.

Use of BibleBot constitutes acceptance of our Privacy Policy.

## 4. Disclaimer

- BibleBot is provided **"as-is"** with no warranties or guarantees.
- The maintainers are not responsible for any outages, inaccuracies in scripture content, or misuse of the bot.
- BibleBot is not affiliated with or endorsed by any Bible translation publishers or religious organizations.
